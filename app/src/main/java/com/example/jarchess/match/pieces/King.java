/**
 * A king is a chess piece that can move 1 square in any direction.
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>It can capture on its normal moves, but doesn't have to.
 * <li>It starts in file e.
 * <li>It starts in rank 8 if black and 1 if white.
 * <li>It can be involved in a special move called a castle where an unmoved rook in starting position
 * and the unmoved king can both be moved when there is no pieces between them. When this happens the king moves two spaces towards the rook and
 * the rook simultaneously moves to the opposite side of the king's destination. During the move, the king
 * must not start, end, or move though a square that is threatened by an enemy piece.
 * <li>If the piece is threatened by an enemy piece, it is in check.
 * <li>A player cannot make a move that would leave their king in check.
 * <li>If a player's that is placed in check cannot make a move to escape check on their turn, they lose the match by checkmate.
 * <li>If a player's that is not in check cannot make a legal move on their turn, the match ends in a draw by stalemate.
 * </ul>
