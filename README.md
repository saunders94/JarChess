# JarChess

Thanks for checking out JarChess.
Currently the game is in development.

## What is JarChess?

JarChess is a Android chess game that incorporates a progression and customization system. The goal from the start was to offer multiple modes of play including single player, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer. The team is also adamant about the app remaining advertisement and gimmick free.

JarChess started as a senior level college project. Three students who happened to sit next to each other on the first day of class decided to form a team and eventually decided to create a mobile chess game.

## Installing and Running the Software

Because the game is not yet released, installation and execution requires the use of a development tool called Android Studio. Android Studio can be downloaded at [Android Studio's Website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Install Android studio following their instructions. After you finish installing Android Studio, go to the [JarChess master branch github page](https://github.com/saunders94/JarChess/tree/master) and click the green "Clone or download" button. Copy the URL, it will be needed soon.

When you Launch android studio, choose "Check out project from version control" and select Git from the drop down menu. You will be asked for a URL, so paste the URL that was copied before. Check that the destination shown is where you want to save the project.

Once you have the project loaded, we need to set up a test device. You can do this by opening the Tools menu and selecting the AVD Manager. Click the "+ Create virtual device..." button. Pick a device from the phone list and click "next". Choose an OS version 5.0 or higher and click next.

At that point you should be able to use the "Run..." option in the Run menu, choosing app, to launch the application in the emulated device.

These instructions worked for us, but additional steps may be needed to get the emulator working on your machine. If things are not working, try to restart your machine and try again. If you continue to have difficulty, you may need to see Android Studio's help resources. We can't offer too much assistance when it comes to android studio problems.

## Additional Resources

Please see the user manual pdf for more details on how to run the application.
